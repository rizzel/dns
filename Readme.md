# Dynamic DNS Server

This project is a dynamic DNS server using PHP and powerDNS.

## Features

* Creation of multiple DNS records for users
* Defining separate update passwords for each record
* Optional reverse DNS records

# Setup

First, some configuration has to be done.
The configuration is located in `htdocs/inc/settings.php`.
As a template the file at `htdocs/inc/settings.default` can be used.

This web interface uses the database schema of powerdns itself and adds some tables.
These tables are generated by the script `createInitialUsers.php`.
It creates the tables (if non existent) and optionally adds an admin.
The script has to be run after powerDNs has created its database schema and after the configuration as described above has been done.

When the init script completes, you can login, switch to the admin panel and add your domain.
You can then add further records to your domain.

Afterwards, users can add their `A`, `AAAA` and `CNAME` records.
